# WEEKEND FEEDBACK SURVEY

## Description
Weekend Challenge

The goal of this project was to create a feedback survey using React-redux to build the webpage.  The App needed contain routing, global reducers to hold responses, then axios POST to send data to database.  An admin page was created, which allows an 'admin' to see all database responses, and gives the ability to flag or delete reviews.  Styling was primarily material-ui.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal - will open up a new browser tab.
